I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science. My hobbies include gaming, mostly simulation games (lol), and I'm currently learning Japanese and English (still struggling 😥).

I love the efficiency of computers and the freedom of open-source culture. I hope to connect with like-minded peers and mentors.

Our future is built together.

## Third Blog

This blog will be updated irregularly. As an aspiring programmer and a newbie, my goal is to reach the stars (just kidding... or not?). While self-studying, I'll share my questions and insights here. I hope readers can offer guidance and join discussions!

## Final Words

I don't know how long this blog will last, but I'll maintain it as much as my energy allows. Hopefully, years later, I'll look back and see how far I've come.

> I know it's cliché to say this upfront, but well—plans never survive reality.
